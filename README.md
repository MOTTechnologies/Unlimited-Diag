# Unlimited-Diag
J2534 Diagnostics and functionality, work in progress PRE-ALPHA

Unlimited Diag is slated to be an extensive collection of OEM automotive diagnostic and reprogramming functions.  Additoinally, I want to implement a powerful network analyzer as well for reverse engineering OBD traffic.  The foundation for this is a robust and useful J2534 .Net library.

At this point, the J2534 library is still evolving and improving, but is very usable in its current form.  I would be interested to hear from people that have found it useful or would like to contribute to the project.

I have a lot of diagnostic procedure information for Ford, Nissan and Chrysler as well as bits and pieces of others. This information includes verified programming seed/key transformations as well as the diagnostic protocol for reflashing. Something that I would like to have is any information on Chrysler SCI diagnostics.  Because it is a serial protocol vs a bus, it is hard to sniff using the hardware I have available.  Consequently, if you have any insight on diagnostic methods using SCI, it would be appreciated.  My goal is create a framework for creating OBD diagnostic software that makes it easy to implement this information.

I welcome all comments, and would love to hear from anyone that has cloned this project.
